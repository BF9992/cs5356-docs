grader notes

* grading will be a bit more complicated so bear with me

* wireframe review
* autograder checks
* functional review of deployed site
* analytics

* autograder checks - most of the verification of the backend code will be by checking the autograder checks, and we can do partial credit for these checks.

the autograder checks have 4 parts to them

* backend lint
* backend test
* frontend build
* frontend lint

You can go to each Pull Request, and then go to the Pull Request checks section to get to the autograder check

Once you've pulled up the autograder results, you can review which ones are passing:

* points off for failing either the frontend build or the backend test autograder
* partial points off for failing the eslint checks altogether (one penalty for either)

functional review

* open up the student submitted website
* you should be able to login
* you should be able to create a class
* you should be able to create

---
wireframe review

missing use cases:
* a landing page
* text boxes for name and question in the ask a question page
* upvote/downvote in the session page
* instructor can create a class
* instructor can create a class session

this is what correct looks like:

* paste the figma wireframe link into this spreadsheet so I can check for dupes
---

plagiarism check

* pull app.js for all students, and compare each one to each other one. someone will submit an identical one.
---

analytics
* the screenshot should be of the right page in firebase
* there should be separate screenshots. partial points off for vague/ambiguous screenshots.

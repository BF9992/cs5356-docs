# Exercise: Define the APIs

For this exercise, you'll take the data model that you worked on in [Exercise: Define the Data Model](./../data-models/exercise-define-data-model) and the functions you wrote in [Exercise: Work with Data in JS](./../data-models/exercise-work-with-data) and you'll define the set of APIs for your application

## Resources

We have 3 resources: `users`, `classes`, and `classSessions`

And we had these functions:

* `createClass(className)`
* `createClassSession(className)`
* `askQuestion(userName, question, classSession)`
* `getClasses(userName)`
* `getClassSession(sessionCode)`

## Exercise

To define your API:
* Choose an HTTP Verb based on the action you want to take
* Create a route for that resource
* Describe an example of data that could be provided

For example:

`createClass(className)`
```text
POST /class

{ "name": "name of the class" }
```
* I chose `POST` because we're going to create a resource
* I chose `/class` because `class` is a resource
* I chose a JSON object with a property called `name` to include the name of the class

## Practice 2.2: Create some elements from external data

Now, for a more real use case - getting data from an external source.

For this exercise, you'll use the `fetch()` API (using Promises) to request data from NYC's Open Data. You'll then read the data and parse it as JSON.

1. Use this [Codepen template](https://codepen.io/intricatecloud/pen/gOjdmgP?editors=1010), or copy the snippet below
2. Read the prompts within the `<script>` section of the Codepen
3. Using the [Vanilla JS cheat sheet](../resources/vanilla-js-cheatsheet.md) + some googling, implement the prompts

<!-- 1. Use fetch() to request the data at datasetUrl -->

<!-- 2. When you get the response, read it as json -->

<!-- 3. Once the data is parsed, iterate through every piece of data  -->

<!-- 4. Create an element for the Name field -->

<!-- 4. Create an element for the Borough field -->

<!-- 5. Append each element to the body -->

# Milestone 2 FAQs and Edits

This is a collection of issues and workarounds that students have found when working with the existing milestone-2 template.

## After I deploy, sometimes my data is there, sometimes its not.

You might notice funny behavior once you deploy your site to Firebase, where sometimes your data is there and sometimes it's not. Sometimes this is due to bugs in your code, and other times, this is due to the way Firebase hosts your code - we'll talk about this in class a little bit.

In any case, because of that issue, I'll be running your apps locally and grading based on how your app behaves on localhost - if the Firebase URL isn't behaving correctly.

So if your deployed Firebase app sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't, don't fret! Submit what you have!

## There are bugs and/or mistakes across the assignment. Is it me or is it the assignment?

Probably a little bit of both!

Arguably, debugging and finding those mistakes is more learning than I could have ever designed on purpose. But I understand its annoying none-the-less.

That said, they aren't there by intention. If you're confused by parts of the assignment:
* thanks for raising them
* use your best judgement to move forward
* you can leave a comment on your Pull Request about it if you weren't sure what to do

In any case, the misprints I'm aware of are in this [diff](https://gist.github.com/intricatecloud/da2f6d98bc422dda0b880cefa45a7db3)

## This is really difficult and/or a lot of work. What if I can't get it all done in time?

If you're looking for a way to focus your efforts, here are some tips based on the rubric:
* Working through the wireframes is an easy way to get 25% of your grade.
* Prioritize getting your code deployed to Firebase. Even a partially working project should be able to get full credit for Hosting & Monitoring.
* Each passing .spec.js file that passes is worth 0.6 points.
* Each use case implemented in the frontend is worth 0.375 points.
* Prioritize having a working, deployed website.

## What about the dismiss feature?

This was included as part of the wireframes, but was not part of the API and the data structure that we created. So you don't need to worry about dismissing as part of the assignment.

## backend: some of the unit tests have the incorrect expectation.

There are a couple of instances where I mistakenly included one thing in the API description, and wrote a different expectation in the unit test. You can view some of those corrections in this [diff](https://gist.github.com/intricatecloud/da2f6d98bc422dda0b880cefa45a7db3).

## backend: Some of my unit tests are randomly failing

A couple of issues I've seen that might be causing this:

* You've added/modified/separated some properties in your `database` object in backend/src/database.js and they aren't being cleared in the `export const clear = () => ...` function.
* You can try adding this to your problematic tests:

```js
// highlight-next-line
import * as db from "../src/database.js";

describe(..., () => {
  let req;
  beforeEach(() => {
    req = request.agent(app);
    // highlight-next-line
    db.clear();
  });
```

## backend: can we add functions to database.js?

Yes.

## frontend: My data structure is different than what the components are expecting

That's ok - the code thats there was written based on one way of implementing the data structure. You might have different property names, you may have organized your data differently.

Read through the React code and modify the components to fit your data. This can involve passing the data as a prop instead, or changing the names of the expected prop values to match your data instead.

## frontend: fetch('/api/user') returns 404

We should be able to use /api paths with React because it is configured to proxy over your Express server, assuming that it is running on `http://localhost:8080`. [See more info about that here](../unit-2/frontend/developing-the-frontend#proxy-api)

Double check:
* frontend/package.json - should contain a proxy property `"proxy": "http://localhost:8080",`
* your backend is actively running. You should be running the frontend in one terminal session, and the backend in another terminal session.

If all that is true, you can try downgrading react-scripts. Edit package.json to change react-scripts to version `4.0.3` and then re-run `npm install`

```json title=backend/package.json
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    ...
    // highlight-next-line
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  },
```

## frontend: error: digital envelope routines::unsupported

Edit package.json to modify the start command, from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69713899).

Edit BOTH the `start` and `build` script.

```json title=backend/package.json
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start",
    "build": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    ...
}
```

## backend: nodemon: command not found

* Make sure you ran `npm install` from the backend/ folder
* Delete your node_modules folder: `rm -rf backend/node_modules/` (on linux)
* The `nodemon` executable should be present in `node_modules/.bin/nodemon`

### Windows - NODE_ENV is not recognized....

```
"NODE_ENV" is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable command or batch file.
```

This happens because in package.json, there are scripts that use the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. The scripts assume that they are running in a Linux/MacOS environment, and that same syntax doesn't work on windows.

2 possible solutions:
* use win-node-env, [see StackOverflow answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40967643)
* use [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env)

If using cross-env, make the following updates:
* from the backend/ folder, run: `npm install --save cross-env`
* edit package.json to use `cross-env` before the NODE_ENV statement

```json title=backend/package.json
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    // highlight-start
    "test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jasmine --reporter=jasmine-console-reporter",
    "test-db": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jasmine --reporter=jasmine-console-reporter spec/database.spec.js",
    "test-login": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jasmine --reporter=jasmine-console-reporter spec/login.spec.js",
    "test-classes": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jasmine --reporter=jasmine-console-reporter spec/class-endpoints.spec.js",
    "test-session-codes": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jasmine --reporter=jasmine-console-reporter spec/class-session-code-endpoints.spec.js",
    "test-class-sessions": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jasmine --reporter=jasmine-console-reporter spec/class-session-endpoints.spec.js",
    // highlight-end
    "lint-report": "eslint --output-file eslint-report.json --format json src/",
    "lint-terminal": "eslint src/",
    "lint": "npm run lint-report; npm run lint-terminal;"
  },
```

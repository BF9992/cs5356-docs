# Express & Node JS Cheat Sheet

Some snippets to help you through common scenarios

## Express

### Modules with Named Exports

If you have a file:

```js title="database.js"
export const getData = () => {
  ...
}
```

* `export` is a keyword to say that this variable can be accessed from another file

Then you can import that file this way:

```js title="app.js"
import { getData } from './database.js'

getData()
```

OR
```js title="app.js"
import * as database from './database.js'
database.getData()
```
### Modules with Default Exports

If you have a file
```js title="database.js"
const getData = () => {
  ...
}
export default getData;
```

* `export default` is a keyword to say that the variable/object will be exported by default from this file
* You can only have 1

Then you can import it:
```js title="app.js"
import getData from './database'

getData()
```


### generateRandomNumber

Generates random 6-digit number

```js
const generateRandomNumber = () => {
  return Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000)
}
```

### Array.find

Given this array

```js
const chatrooms = [{
  name: "channel-1"
}, {
  name: "channel-2"
}]
```

Find an element, given a condition defined as a function. Will return the 1st item it finds, or undefined if it can't find anything
```
const chatroom = chatrooms.find(chatroom => chatroom.name === 'channel-1')
if (chatroom) {
  console.log('found the chatroom!')
} else {
  console.log('No chatroom found')
}
```

### Array.filter

Given this data:

```js
const chatrooms = [{
  name: "channel-1",
  members: []
}, {
  name: "channel-2",
  members: ["danny"]
}]
```

Returns all elements that match a condition defined as a function. Will return a new array with all matching items.

```js
const chatroomsWithMembers = chatrooms.filter(chatroom => chatroom.members.length > 0)
if (chatroomsWithMembers.length === 0) {
  console.log('No chatrooms found')
} else {
  console.log('Found chatrooms with members', chatroomsWithMembers)
}
```
